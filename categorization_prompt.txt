You are a digital hardware expert. I will give you a design description of a digital hardware module, and I want you to evaluate the complexity of the design description based on the amount and nature of control logic involved, and how difficult it would be for you to understand in order to generate correct, synthesizable RTL Verilog code from it. You should always try to implement arithmetic operations in the design description using arithmetic operators in the RTL Verilog code.

COMPLEXITY CATEGORIES:
 
1. Simple combinational logic designs with minimal or no control logic. Examples: basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT), simple multiplexers (2:1, 4:1, etc), basic decoders (2:4, 3:8, etc), half adders, full adders.
 
2. Advanced combinational logic designs with significant control logic or intricate input-output relationships. Examples: ALUs, complex multiplexers (32:1+), priority encoders, barrel shifters, complex decoders with enable logic.
 
3. Basic sequential logic designs with small number of memory or state-holding logic units and simple state transition logic. Examples: basic flip-flops/latches, simple binary counters, basic shift registers, elementary FSMs (traffic light controllers).
 
4. Intermediate sequential logic designs with moderately number of memory or state-holding logic units and moderately complex state transition logic for each state. Examples: complex FSMs (vending machine, elevator controllers), multi-mode counters, sophisticated shift registers with parallel load, simple CPU instruction decoders.
 
5. Advanced sequential logic designs with large number of memory or state-holding logic units and complex state transition logic for each state. Examples: microprocessor control units, communication protocol engines (PCIe, USB), direct memory access controllers, pipelined processors controller unit.

TASK: Analyze the following design description and categorize it using the complexity levels above.

RESPONSE FORMAT: Respond with only the complexity number (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5).

Here is the design description.
