Please act as a professional Verilog designer.

Implement a combinational logic module that performs the function of a 2-to-4 decoder. The decoder accepts a 2-bit binary input and outputs 4 lines, where exactly one output line is asserted high (1) corresponding to the binary input value.

Module name:
decoder_2x4

Input ports:
- in [1:0]: 2-bit input vector representing the binary value.

Output ports:
- out [3:0]: 4-bit one-hot output vector where only one bit is high at a time, indicating the decoded output line.

Internal logic:
1. One-Hot Decode: The 2-bit input is mapped to a one-hot 4-bit output such that out[0] corresponds to input 2'b00, out[1] to 2'b01, out[2] to 2'b10, and out[3] to 2'b11.

2. Combinational Operation: The module is purely combinational; outputs update immediately with changes on the input.

3. Undefined Input Handling: If the input contains unknown (X) or high-impedance (Z) values, drive the output to 4'bxxxx to reflect an invalid decode in simulation.
