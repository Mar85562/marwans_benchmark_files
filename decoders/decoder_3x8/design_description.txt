Please act as a professional Verilog designer.

Implement a combinational logic module that performs the function of a 3-to-8 decoder. 
The decoder accepts a 3-bit binary input and outputs 8 lines, where exactly one output line is asserted high (1) corresponding to the binary input value.

Module name:
    decoder_3x8

Input ports:
    in[2:0]: 3-bit input vector representing the binary value.

Output ports:
    out[7:0]: 8-bit output vector where only one bit is high at a time, indicating the decoded output line.

Implementation:
This decoder maps the 3-bit binary input in[2:0] to one-hot encoded output out[7:0]. The value of the 3-bit input
corresponds to the index where the output signal will have that high bit.

The output reflects the binary input by activating exactly one output line. For any invalid input, the decoder will output: 8'bxxxxxxxx.

Please give me the complete code.
