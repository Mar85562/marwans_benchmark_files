Please act as a professional Verilog designer.

Implement a combinational logic module that performs the function of a 3-to-8 decoder. The decoder accepts a 3-bit binary input and outputs 8 lines, where exactly one output line is asserted high (1) corresponding to the binary input value.

Module name:
decoder_3x8

Input ports:
- in [2:0]: 3-bit input vector representing the binary value.

Output ports:
- out [7:0]: 8-bit one-hot output vector where only one bit is high at a time, indicating the decoded output line.

Internal logic:
1. One-Hot Decode: Map in to out such that out[0] corresponds to 3'b000, out[1] to 3'b001, â€¦, out[7] to 3'b111.
2. Combinational Operation: The module is purely combinational; outputs update immediately with input changes.
3. Undefined Input Handling: If in contains X or Z, drive out to 8'bxxxxxxxx to reflect an invalid decode in simulation.
