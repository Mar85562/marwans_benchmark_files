Please act as a professional Verilog designer.

Implement a combinational logic module that performs the function of a 4-to-16 decoder. The decoder accepts a 4-bit binary input and outputs 16 lines, where exactly one output line is asserted high (1) corresponding to the binary input value.

Module name:
decoder_4x16

Input ports:
- in [3:0]: 4-bit input vector representing the binary value.

Output ports:
- out [15:0]: 16-bit one-hot output vector where only one bit is high at a time, indicating the decoded output line.

Internal logic:
1. One-Hot Decode: Map in to out such that out[i] = 1 only when in equals the 4-bit binary of i (i âˆˆ 0..15).
2. Combinational Operation: The module is purely combinational; outputs update immediately with input changes.
3. Undefined Input Handling: If in contains X or Z, drive out to 16'bxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx to reflect an invalid decode in simulation.
