Please act as a professional Verilog designer.

Implement a combinational logic module that performs the function of a 4-to-2 encoder. The encoder accepts 4 input lines, where only one input is asserted high (1) at a time, and outputs a 2-bit binary code that corresponds to the index of the high input.

Module name:
encoder_4x2

Input ports:
- in [3:0]: 4-bit input vector; exactly one bit is high at a time.

Output ports:
- out [1:0]: 2-bit binary output indicating the index of the asserted input line.

Internal logic:
1. Single-Hot Encode: Map in to out such that if in[i]=1 (and all other bits are 0), then out equals the 2-bit binary representation of i (i is an element of 0..3). Example: in=4'b0010 â‡’ out=2'b01.
2. Combinational Operation: The module is purely combinational; outputs update immediately with input changes.
3. Invalid Input Handling: If multiple inputs are high or all inputs are low, drive out to 2'bxx to indicate an invalid condition in simulation.
