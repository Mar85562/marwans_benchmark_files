Please act as a professional Verilog designer.

Implement a combinational logic module that performs the function of an 8-to-3 encoder. The encoder accepts 8 input lines, where only one input is asserted high (1) at a time, and outputs a 3-bit binary code that corresponds to the index of the high input.

Module name:
encoder_8x3

Input ports:
- in [7:0]: 8-bit input vector; exactly one bit is high at a time.

Output ports:
- out [2:0]: 3-bit binary output indicating the index of the asserted input line.

Internal logic:
1. Single-Hot Encode: Map in to out such that if in[i]=1 (and all other bits are 0), then out equals the 3-bit binary representation of i (i is an element of 0..7). Example: in=8'b00000100 â‡’ out=3'b010.
2. Combinational Operation: The module is purely combinational; outputs update immediately with input changes.
3. Invalid Input Handling: If multiple inputs are high or all inputs are low, drive out to 3'bxxx to indicate an invalid condition in simulation.
